# Frontend Coding Exercise – Memory Game

## Objective
Build a memory game using **React**. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to design and structure a small application, manage state, and deliver clean, maintainable code.

This is a React project using **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. You are free to use any tools, libraries, or approaches you prefer. Please use the packages already installed in the project first, and install anything else you need.

## Requirements
- Create a React app with three pages:
  1. **Start Page** – where the player can enter their name and begin the game.
  2. **Game Page** – where the memory game is played.
     - The player's name and a timer should be visible.
     - The game board should consist of a grid of tiles.
     - The game should end once all pairs have been found.
  3. **End Page** – shown when the game is finished, displaying the player's name and result.
- Tiles:
  - **Back side**: use `growy_logo.svg` from the public folder.
  - **Front side**: use images from the provided list in the public folder (selection is up to you).
- Support different board sizes (e.g., 2x2, 6x6, 4x5).
- Implement one additional minor feature of your choice to enhance the game experience.
- Write unit tests for at least one component or page of your choice.
- The project should pass **eslint** and **prettier** checks. You can run these checks using the scripts in [package.json](./package.json).
